## About Merry Meals 

Merry Meals is a web-based application that offers a unique solution for meal delivery. The primary logic behind Merry Meals is the geographical proximity of the user to the food pickup location. Here's how it works:

- Users located within a 10-kilometer radius from the pickup location can order hot meals.
- Users located beyond the 10-kilometer radius will be delivered cold meals. 🌡️❄️

This approach ensures that users receive their meals at the optimal temperature, enhancing their dining experience.

- **Frontend**: React ⚛️ , Boostrap
